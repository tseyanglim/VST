    "Simple standalone `py` / `ipynb` widget for replacing text in a list of files, based on a dictionary of 'old' text to be replaced and 'new' text to replace with. Useful for changing multiple variable names simultaneously across a suite of text-readable Vensim files (e.g. `mdl`, `cin`, `voc`, `vgd`, `vpd`, `lst`, etc.) so that nothing breaks, as is likely with manual renaming.\n",

    "1. `filelist` - a simple text-format list of files or filepaths (relative or absolute), one file name on each line\n",
    "2. `varnamedict` - a JSON-format dictionary matching keys (text to be replaced) to values (text to replace with)\n",
